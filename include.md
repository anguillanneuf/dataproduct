### Welcome to Smart Competitive TV Scheduler

This application is based on simulated TV audience data.

Source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/anguillanneuf/dataproduct).

A short presentation is available on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/anguillanneuf/smart_tv_scheduler).

You can input different values for different demographics for a new show using the sliders on the left in the Plot section.

When you hit Submit, a new dendrogram-cum-heatmap is produced with the new show in it.

Generally speaking, it's a bad idea to schedule the new show with shows that are clustered in the same branch as it because they will compete for the same type of audience in terms of age and gender. 

The dataset can be downloaded from the Data tab.

Please note: In media math, VPVH stand for Demographic Viewers for One Thousand Households. For a basic understanding, the higher the value for a particular demographic is, the more popular a show is for that particular demographic. The minimum and maximum values set for the different demographic groups are based on real TV audience data.
